# javaProject
An I/O project that functions as a virtual course registration system  
/* Course registration System:
 *
 * >The course registration system is first come first serve.
 * >If a class is full, the user has an option to be put on the wait-list. The first student put on the
 * wait list will be the first to be taken off the wait-list. The registration system sends the student
 * a message when a student is put on/off a wait-list.
 *
 * >Student is able to:
 * 	    1.register for classes.
 * 		2. drop classes.
 * 		3. search for information about a specific course
 * 		4. retrieve their password in case they forgot.
 * 		5. read messages from the registration system (burn after being read).
 * 	    6. send messages to each other.
 *
> We have three students already registered in the System: John Doe, Andrew Carnegie and Lynn Aniston. The viewer
should be able to sign up for a new account or using any of the existing accounts. Each student can log in using their first name. When registering for a class they have the option to set their password. If a
password is set, it will be required every time at log-in in in the future.

 * >In the main function, we intialised a System s and opened it through the function openServer().
 *  Running in console, we will be able to walk through each of their registration experience.
